# Facial landmark detection using OpenCV Facemark API

![lock stock](http://mishurov.co.uk/images/github/cv_ml_probes/facemark.png)

 - Face detection using Haar-cascades
 - Facial landmark detection using Regression Trees
 - Pose estimation using iterative algorithm for solving PnP problem

There's the script "train.sh" which builds the trainer and starts training proess but, to be frank, the result is a bit weird thus for the demo I use the pretrained model from OpenCV sources. The model can be downloaded manually from the link in "dependencies.sh" in the root of the repository.
